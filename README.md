In July 2023 I was awarded a Masters with Merit in Mathematics & Statistics from the University of Oxford, achieving a Distinction in my dissertation. 

I am now applying for a PHD in Reinforcement Learning, to start in Autumn 2024.

## Masters 
Below is a summary of my most relevant fourth year modules, along with their marks.

Dissertation: **70** I focussed on a Q-Learning model for molecular optimisation (MolDQN), a strategy proposed to save time and money in pharmaceutical drug discovery. My paper explored whether changes in the loss function would improve the model. [Read Dissertation Here](https://github.com/carissacullen/carissacullen/blob/main/Dissertation-Final.pdf)

*Topics in Computational Biology* mini-project: **72** I concentrated on Reinforcement Learning for chemical plume tracing (CPT) using autonomous underwater vehicles. The RL model I explored was a Deterministic Policy Gradient method. [Read TiCB Mini-Project Here](https://github.com/carissacullen/carissacullen/blob/main/TopicsInComputationalBiology-Final.pdf)

*Theories of Deep Learning* mini-project: **66** I explored progressive distillation, a method to improve the sampling speed of Diﬀusion Models. [Read ToDL Mini-Project Here](https://github.com/carissacullen/carissacullen/blob/main/TheoriesOfDeepLearning-Final.pdf)

*Advanced Topics in Statistical Machine Learning* exam: **68**
